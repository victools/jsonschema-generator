# Introduction

The [victools/jsonschema-generator](https://github.com/victools/jsonschema-generator) repository is home to multiple artifacts that are published independently to ["The Central Repository" (Sonatype)](https://central.sonatype.org/) and from there to others like "Maven Central".
Besides the main generator library itself, there are a few modules providing some standard configurations for your convenience.

<aside class="notice">
    There may be other available modules outside of this repository. Refer to the main <a href="https://github.com/victools/jsonschema-generator/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for the list of known modules.
</aside>

This documentation aims at always covering the latest released version of the `jsonschema-generator` and its (standard) modules. There is no documentation for previous versions at this stage.
Please refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/victools/jsonschema-generator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of the incremental changes.
